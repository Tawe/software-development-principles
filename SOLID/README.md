# ðŸ§± SOLID Principles

The **SOLID** principles are five foundational guidelines for writing maintainable, scalable, and robust object-oriented software. Coined by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), these principles help developers avoid code rot, reduce coupling, and improve clarity.

Each letter in "SOLID" stands for one principle:

## ðŸ“– Principles Overview

### ðŸ§© S â€” Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.**  
Each module or class should be focused on a single task or responsibility. When a class has too many responsibilities, it's harder to modify, test, or extend.

### ðŸ§³ O â€” Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**  
You should be able to extend a classâ€™s behavior without modifying its source code â€” often done using polymorphism or composition.

### ðŸªž L â€” Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.**  
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application. Violating this causes unexpected behavior and subtle bugs.

### ðŸ§ƒ I â€” Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.**  
It's better to have several small, specific interfaces than one large, general-purpose one. This keeps classes focused and avoids implementing unused methods.

---

### ðŸ§ª D â€” Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.**  
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This decouples your code and improves testability.
